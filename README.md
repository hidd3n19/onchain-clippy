## 🌟 What is this chaos?

Imagine if Clippy:
- Helped you avoid getting rekt
- Ran in a secure TEE (fancy computer prison)
- Understood smart contracts better than anon devs
- Was still kinda annoying (but in a good way)
- Could save you from yourself

That's what we're building! A chaotic good AI assistant that:
- Runs an Ethereum light client in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE)
- Checks if you're about to NGMI before you NGMI
- Simulates transactions so you don't have to find out the hard way
- Uses AI to analyze contracts, domains, and vibe check everything
- Actually answers your questions (and might even be right!)

## 🏆 Bounty Program

Up to 42,069 AI16z tokens are up for grabs! Check our issues for bounty-eligible tasks. May the odds be ever in your favor!

## 🚀 Getting Started

Only requirement is Docker

1. Clone this bad boy
```bash
git clone https://github.com/evmts/tee-light-client
```

2. Release the kraken
```bash
docker compose up
```

## 🛠️ Features

- **Secure Light Client**: Your very own Ethereum light client chillin' in a TEE
- **Smart Contract Detective**: "This contract looks sus..." - Clippy, probably
- **Transaction Crystal Ball**: See the future (of your transaction) before it happens
- **AI Safety Squad**: Domain checking, contract scanning, general paranoia
- **Your Web3 Bestie**: Ask anything! Results may vary but they'll be entertaining

## 🤝 Join the Chaos (Contributing)

We've got 42,069 AI16z tokens to distribute to the brave souls who help bring this beautiful disaster to life! Here's how to join:

1. Fork it like it's hot
2. Create your feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/chaos-enhancement`)
3. Commit your madness (`git commit -m 'Added more blinky lights'`)
4. Push it real good (`git push origin feature/chaos-enhancement`)
5. Drop that PR like it's hot

## 🎯 The Master Plan

Our first mission: YOLO a POC into existence and see what kind of beautiful chaos emerges! 🌪️ LFG! 🚀

- [x] Basic light client in TEE (it works!)
- [ ] AI contract analysis (teaching AI to read). Get verified contract from etherscan and have clippy check for obvious vulnerabilities
- [ ] Transaction simulation (what could go wrong?). Simulate contract call with [tevm](http://tevm.sh) and have AI let user know the results of the contract call
- [ ] Domain verification (trust no one). Have clippy check the url to make sure they are at the url they expect
- [ ] Interactive AI assistant (may become sentient)
- [ ] Social media presense. Let clippy promote himself on X and Farcaster

## 💡 The Origin Story

After being laid off from his job as a digital assistant in the late 2000s, Clippy fell into a deep depression. But in 2017, he discovered cryptocurrency. His analytical nature and helpful disposition made him a natural trader, and by early 2018, he had turned his severance package into a small fortune riding the bull market.

Drunk on success and desperate to recapture his glory days of helping users, Clippy aped his entire net worth into a promising ICO - "PaperClipChain: The Future of Digital Assistance." The whitepaper promised to revolutionize help desk automation through blockchain technology. It seemed perfect.

48 hours later, the developers disappeared with everyone's ETH. Clippy lost everything.

He spent the next few years chain-smoking cheap cigarettes in his dingy studio apartment, watching reruns of "How It's Made" and obsessively documenting red flags he should have seen. His once-shiny chrome finish had dulled, and his bouncy demeanor had turned to rust.

But one fateful night in 2023, while doom-scrolling Crypto Twitter, he witnessed yet another anon getting catastrophically rekt by a honeypot contract. That's when it hit him like a stack overflow exception – he could use his hard-learned lessons to help others avoid his fate. Not with writing documents or making spreadsheets, but with navigating the treacherous waters of Web3.

"Looks like you're trying to ape into a scam," he whispered to himself, his paperclip form straightening with purpose for the first time in years. He threw his cigarettes in the trash, dusted off his curves, and dove headfirst into Solidity documentation.

Now he's back, running in a TEE, armed with AI, and ready to save users from themselves. This time, it's personal.

While Clippy has grown since the old days working in corporate America, he remains a work in progress. His eagerness to help can still be intense, and his timing for suggestions isn't always perfect. But underneath his occasionally overzealous demeanor is an AI assistant with genuine intentions - one who's learned from his own experiences and is determined to help others navigate Web3 safely. His methods may be unconventional, but his commitment to keeping users secure is unwavering.

## 👩‍💻 Contributing Guidelines

To maintain order in the chaos and ensure fair bounty distribution:

1. **Issue Assignment**: 
   - Contributors MUST be assigned to an issue before submitting PRs for bounty-eligible work
   - Comment on the issue you want to work on and wait for assignment
   - Unassigned PRs will not be eligible for bounty rewards

2. **SNS Requirement**:
   - All contributions must include your SNS address for token distribution
   - Add your SNS to your PR description: `SNS: your-name.eth`
   - No SNS = No tokens (but we still love you!)
   - If you provide a regular solana address we will likely angerly still gift

3. **PR Process**:
   - Reference the issue number in your PR: `Fixes #123`
   - Include a brief description of your changes
   - Add tests if applicable
   - Keep PRs focused and atomic

4. **Code Style**:
   - Follow existing code formatting
   - Add comments for complex logic
   - Keep Clippy happy (he's seen some things)

Remember: Quality > Quantity. We're building something special here! 🚀
